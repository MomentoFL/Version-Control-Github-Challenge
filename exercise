1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

The terminal is like an operating system and also another method to explore through the system's files or performing actions with them. I always felt like I'm "hacking into the mainframe" whenever I'm using the terminal, when really it's just me using "cd" and "touch" to mess with some files.

2. What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a decentralized or distributed version control system, while Github is a hosting service for doing repositories.

So if you think about it, Git is what we can use to make and use files, while Github is an online service where we can host and push our files into a repository.

They both share a few similarities, which makes them a nice duo to work with.

3. What are the steps to fork a GitHub repository?

A. On Github, find your repository or your team's repository

B. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork

C. Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository

D. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.

	1. Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
	2. Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only.

For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. If you do not select this option, all branches will be copied into the new fork.

E. Click "Create fork".
